                <h2>Hello, I'm Xiaohan Zhang</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate Bayern Munich fan who enjoys following their games and celebrating their victories. Currently residing in Canada, I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge in cybersecurity and digital forensics.</p>
                <p>As a computer enthusiast, I love building game desktops and staying up-to-date with the latest hardware trends. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for Audi cars, always eager to learn about the latest models and technological advancements.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and collecting soccer cards, particularly rare and valuable ones. I am also a cat lover and cherish the moments spent with my furry friends.</p>
                <p>My academic journey led me to the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Forensic Investigation with a specialization in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity. I also hold a diploma in Computer Information System Administration from BCIT.</p>
